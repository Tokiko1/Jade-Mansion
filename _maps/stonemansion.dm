#define FORCE_MAP "_maps/stonemansion.json"

//Note: Stonemansion is a very, very tiny map.
//It is not intended for normal rounds since it is much too small.
//Even if you have a very small group of people to play with, you do want to play the enormous, mazeous maps instead.
//As such, this map is completely unbalanced in any of the modes, even chaotic day.
//It is however a good example on how to make maps for jademansion, for testing features and for RP.
//Despite being unbalanced, it should still work with any gamemode.
