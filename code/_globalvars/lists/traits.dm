//So you want to make a new trait? Not too difficult!
//Simply add it to the list below.
//If it's a trait that is meant to process constantly, like to check for a condition, make a datum/trait and put its type under "active"
//If it's a static thing that other stuff checks, no need for this
//If this is a trait that is meant to grant an ability or give out an ability at roundstart, handle it in /datum/controller/subsystem/ticker/proc/handle_join_traits() in trait_roundstarts.dm
//Don't put too many traits on a page or stuff might crash on slower computers, and will be annoying to scroll through.
//If you need a new page, number it properly and the game will handle everything else automatically.

//Where are all the trait related files?

//subsystem/traits_roundstarts.dm
//This is where items and abilities associated with traits are given out and where active traits are assigned
//client/traits.dm
//The trait menu.
//modules/traits/processingtraits.dm
//This is where active traits that process stuff are.
//modules/traits/traitabilities.dm
//Here are abilities that are given by traits.
//modules/traits/traititems.dm
//Here are items that are given by traits.
//_globalvars/lists/traits.dm
//This file here.
